Some of my vanilla shaders that I made for fun. You can use them as long as you don't sell them, don't pass them off as your own, and provide a link to this repo.

## GUI Avatars

A shader that renders a nice picture of any skin using player heads.<br>
Highly inspired by Spheya's shader (used it as reference).
